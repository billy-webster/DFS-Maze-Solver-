# Maze Solver - Personal Project

##  Project Overview
A Python-based maze solver that uses Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm with real-time visualisation. This small personal project demonstrates pathfinding algorithms and Pygame visualization in an interactive way.


##  Algorithm Details
- **DFS Approach**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- **8-directional Movement**: Can move up, down, left, right, and diagonally
- **Backtracking**: Automatically removes incorrect paths from solution
- **Validation**: Checks for walls and boundaries before moving

## Sample Maze
The project includes a pre-defined 14x14 maze with:
- Start position: (0,0) - Top-left
- End position: (13,13) - Bottom-right
- Complex path with dead ends and multiple routes

## Personal Learning Goals
This project helped me understand:
- DFS algorithm implementation
- Recursive backtracking
